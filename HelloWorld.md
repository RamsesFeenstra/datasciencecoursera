I had lots of trouble linking up my notepad file to this using git because they were not located in the same directory. If you had the same trouble this may help. I found a video on youtube. It was just some guy listening to some hard rock and demoing how to attach notepad file to github repo.  He used windows just as you would normally move files in any other situation. I was quite tired as this took all day to figure out so sorry i cannot recall the exact steps.  Have a great day
